      <description>Come to Fiji with us and stay at the award winning 4-star Fiji dive resort Volivoli Beach Resort. The trip includes a 7-night stay, 6 days of boat diving (up to 12 dives) plus unlimited shore diving, 3 meals daily, beach BBQ, traditional Meke performance, and more.
 Arriving at the resort by noon, you can go shore diving as soon as you are settled in, if you are up to it!</description>
