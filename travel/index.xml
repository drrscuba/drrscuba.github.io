      <description>A Divers Paradise Bonaire is truly a diver&amp;rsquo;s paradise! It has been consistently rated as a top dive destination around the world and is just a 4 hour flight from Atlanta and 5 hour flight from Houston. Once there, take your rental truck (included with each apartment) and your dive buddy along the coastal road to choose which of the about 60 official dive sites you want to explore. With so many dive sites easily accessible from shore it has become the shore diving capital of the world.</description>
